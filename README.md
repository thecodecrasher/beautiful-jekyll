# Personal Site
#### (made with Beautiful Jekyll)

This is my personal attempt on creating a site using jekyll.

## Starting locally 

> gem install jekyll bundler
> bundle
> bundle exec jekyll build
> bundle exec jekyll serve

To use multiple github users read this [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/manage-multiple-github-accounts-the-ssh-way-2dadc30ccaca/). And before starting pushing don't forget to set an email like this:
> git config user.email
